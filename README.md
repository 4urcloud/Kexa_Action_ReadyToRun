**Manual trigger**

Every addon has its associated workflow. (example : for Azure there is azure.yml, AWS there is aws.yml)

Tnere is a global workflow to trigger and schedule all addons at once named "kexa.yml"
This one is just a trigger to call all other workflows.

If you want to try a specific addon manually, click on the workflow from the Github 'Action' page, then
on "run workflow", and then click on "run workflow" again from the pop-up window.

/// SCREEN SHOT HERE ///

By triggering the manual option, you can check that your credentials are correct once you've defined them in the Github repository.

**Scheduled trigger**

As mentioned before, the "kexa.yml" workflow can trigger all other workflows at a certain date/time or interval.

It is defined in the "kexa.yml" as a cronjob, to know more about how to use and define cronjob, you can refer to this documentation : https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07

// SCREEN SHOT HERE //

You can also use services like https://crontab.guru/ or https://crontab-generator.org/ that will help you write the cronjob you need.

### üéØ Expected Results

### üõ†Ô∏è More configuration options

Kexa git action is based on the core project Kexa : https://github.com/4urcloud/Kexa/
This is just a quick launch repository, but below there is some additionals configuration you can set
without having to read the Kexa core documentation.

To have more advanced options and editing tutorial, refer to the core project documentation.

##### Enabling / Disabling rules, Editing & Error levels

##### Specifying alert channels

You can visualize the results of a scan in the Github workflow logs, but Kexa as a lot more to offer, with different notifications channels such as :

- [x] Email
- [x] Microsoft Teams
- [x] SMS
- [x] Webhook
- [] Jira

Naturally, you'll get a structured, easy-to-read set of results, with as much precision as logs, but less text data.

To know more about how to use those channels : 

##### Using multiple subscriptions/projects for a provider
