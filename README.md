## ‚è∞ 3. Running & Scheduling

<br/><br/>

<div align="center">
<h3>

**Manual trigger (for testing or one shot scan)**

</h3>
</div>
<br/>

Every addon has its associated workflow. (example : for Azure there is azure.yml, AWS there is aws.yml)<br/><br/>
Each addon workflow has a manual trigger, if you want to directly schedule the scan with a date/time or interval,
please keep reading to the next section 'Scheduled Trigger'.<br/>
<br/>
For manual trigger, go to "*Actions*" in your repository, and select the workflow from the addon
you wish to trigger :<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="readme-images/step3.png" alt="Logo" height="auto">
</div>
<br/><br/>
Then you can click on "run workflow", and then click on "run workflow" again from the pop-up window.
<br/><br/>
<div align="center">
    <img src="readme-images/step4.png" alt="Logo" height="auto">
</div>

<br/><br/>
By triggering the manual option, you can check that your credentials are correct once you've defined them in the Github repository.

<br/><br/>
<div align="center">
<h3>

**Scheduled trigger**

</h3>
</div>
<br/>

Tnere is a global workflow to trigger and schedule all addons at once named "kexa.yml"<br/>
This one is just a trigger to call all other workflows.<br/>
<br/>
It is defined in the "kexa.yml" as a cronjob, to know more about how to use and define cronjob, you can refer to this documentation :<br/>  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07 <br/>
<br/>
By default, it will trigger every addons every day at 12:00pm.<br/>
To change this, open "/.github/workflows/kexa.yml" and change the cronjob as you wish<br/>
<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="readme-images/stepSchedule.png" alt="Logo" height="auto">

You can also use services like https://crontab.guru/ or https://crontab-generator.org/ that will help you write the cronjob you need.

## üéØ 4. Expected Results

<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. More configuration options

Kexa git action is based on the core project Kexa : https://github.com/4urcloud/Kexa/
This is just a quick launch repository, but below there is some additionals configuration you can set
without having to read the Kexa core documentation.

To have more advanced options and editing tutorial, refer to the core project documentation.

<br/>

##### Enabling / Disabling rules, Editing & Error levels

##### Specifying alert channels

You can visualize the results of a scan in the Github workflow logs, but Kexa as a lot more to offer, with different notifications channels such as :

- [x] Email
- [x] Microsoft Teams
- [x] SMS
- [x] Webhook
- [] Jira

Naturally, you'll get a structured, easy-to-read set of results, with as much precision as logs, but less text data.

To know more about how to use those channels :
